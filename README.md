# Text-to-Speech

This project is a simple text-to-speech application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can enter text into an input field and then click the "Speak" button to have the entered text spoken aloud using the Espeak speech synthesis engine.

The GUI consists of a main window with a label frame titled "Text to speech". Inside the label frame, there is a label ("Text"), an entry field for the user to enter text, and a button labeled "Speak". The user can type the desired text into the entry field, and upon clicking the "Speak" button, the text is passed to the Espeak engine for speech synthesis. The speech output is then played using the user's speakers or headphones.

The intended audience for this project could be anyone who wants a basic text-to-speech functionality. It can be used for various purposes such as assisting individuals with visual impairments, creating voiceovers for multimedia content, or simply for fun and experimentation with text-to-speech technology.
